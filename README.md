# Move over OOP / C++ Structs and Classes : Use Functional C++ using std::tuple

*It may be a matter of debate whether the Object Oriented Programming __(OOP)__   has served its intended purpose or not, but there is no denying that the things like inheritance, virtual, abstraction, polymorphism etc in C++ (though provided great flexibility) leads to complicated code with Multiple hierarchies and relationship which become worse as the code grown.*

## Disclaimer : *Before reading further.....*

*This page is not about bashing OOP. OOP Programming may very well be suited for some problems. However, I found that functional way much less error prone and with the availability of new features in C++11 onwards like* **std::tuples,** *its possible to code in C++ without excessive using complicated classes inheritance and dependencies.*

*This page is intended to demonstrate the use of std::tuple in place of C++ structures and classes*

## Module - 1 [The usage of std::tuple](https://github.com/9lean/Move_Over_ObjectOriented_Using_tuples/tree/master/Usage%20of%20tuples)
*This module will explain the basic usage of std::tuple*

## Module - 2 [Adding Functions and Functional Behaviour in std::tuple ](https://github.com/9lean/Move_Over_ObjectOriented_Using_tuples/tree/master/Functional_Tuples)
*This module describe the way of adding functions and using those with the paradigms of __Functional Programming__*
