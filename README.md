# Move over C++ Structs and Classes
## Use Functional C++ using std::tuple

_Languages like C++ and Java are synonymous with_ __classes__ _and_ __structs__. _Any meaningful program in the said language can't be imagined without these keywords_. 

_The main reason of having_ __classes__ _and_ __structs__, _so as we can create user defined types by combining built in types_. 

_With C++11, its possible to create user defined types with_ __std::tuple__. _Not only it allows creating user defined types, but can also contain C++ functions in it_

_This page demonstrates the usage of_ __std::tuple__ _and also talks about it can potentially replace_ __classes__ _and_ __structs__ _in C++_.

### Functional Programming and C++

_Its beyond a doubt that functional programming far exceeds the procedural and object oriented programming in terms of safety and reliability. with C++11, functional programming is imbibed into C++ and can be used for writing functional code._ 
__std::tuple__ _has all ingredients to be an enabler of functional code. Its far easier to write functional code with_ __std::tuple__ _while its almost impossible to do the same with_ __classes__ _and_ __structs_.
